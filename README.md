## About
Flask Modules is built for the [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/projects/flask) framework by [Pallets Projects](https://palletsprojects.com/). This package is designed to allow for quick loading of modules by using the name of the module directory as the name of the corresponding Flask blueprint. The Module Manager will review the directory and determine if the criteria have been met for a module, and it will load it as a blueprint.

## Requirements
- Flask
- os
- importlib

## Getting Started
1. Create a 'Modules' directory in the same directory as your main Python script.
2.
